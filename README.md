Descripiton:The Python-based Student Ranking System is designed to manage and rank students based on their academic performance. This system evaluates students' grades, computes their average, and ranks them accordingly.

Features:
Student Class:

Attributes:
name (str): The student's name.
grades (dict): A dictionary where keys are subject names and values are the respective grades.
Methods:
add_grade(subject, grade): Adds or updates a grade for a subject.
calculate_average_grade(): Computes the average of all grades.
get_letter_grade(average): Determines the letter grade based on the average grade.
display_grades(): Shows the student's grades, average, letter grade, and GPA.
calculate_gpa(average): Converts the average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Ranking System:

Data Collection: Multiple Student objects are created and their grades are added.
Ranking:
The system calculates each studentâ€™s average grade and GPA.
Students are then ranked based on their GPA or average grade.
Output: Displays the ranked list of students, showing their names, average grades, and GPA.
Implementation Steps:
Create Student Instances: Instantiate Student objects and input grades.
Calculate Averages and GPAs: For each student, compute the average grade and GPA.
Rank Students: Sort students based on GPA or average grade in descending order.
Display Rankings: Output the list of students in ranked order, including their academic performance metrics.
This system provides a clear method to evaluate and rank students, making it easier to understand their relative academic standings.

Conclusion
The Student Ranking System provides a structured approach to evaluating and comparing student performance. By managing student grades, calculating averages and GPAs, and sorting students based on these metrics, the system offers a clear view of academic standings. This functionality supports educators in identifying top performers and areas where improvement is needed. The ability to rank students effectively facilitates better decision-making regarding academic interventions, recognitions, and progress tracking. Overall, the system enhances transparency and efficiency in academic assessments, making it a valuable tool for educational institutions.
